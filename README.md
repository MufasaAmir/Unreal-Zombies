# Unreal-Zombies Design Doc
# Description
The Game is a Zombie survival fps with an unlimited horde of spawning zombies ready to eat your flesh, the usual. The apocalypse has already arrived, and there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. All you can hope to do is survive as long as possible, and maybe make it on the leaderboards before you die a slow, agonizing death to the undead.  
# Scale 
The scale of the map will be that of whatever’s the coolest free map I can find on the Unreal Marketplace. The player character will be the size of an average adult male, so the map would ideally be around the size of a small suburban block. This will give the player plenty of room to breathe in as the zombies start spawning in at a progressively higher pace. The zombies will be around the same size s the player as well, albeit slower. Each round will have 50% more zombies than the last, starting with 10. With each round ending when either all the zombies have been killed or the player is dead. 
# Models
The player character is a generic adult male model with rugged clothing, taken from the online asset store. The zombies will come from the Zombies pack from the asset store as well. Animations will  come from the asset store and/or Mixamo. The houses, cars, and random street obstacles will be extracted from one big asset pack from the Unreal Marketplace.
# Materials and Textures 
The materials and textures will mostly come from the asset packs downloaded from various asset stores. Some specific textures will be made in Photoshop if need be to make signs that instruct the player on how to play the game. These will be in the form of writing on the walls akin to iconic scenes from the Walking Dead and other Zombie Media.
